The curses module provides an interface to the curses library, the de-facto standard for portable advanced terminal handling.

While ```curses``` is most widely used in the Unix environment, versions are available for DOS, OS/2, and possibly other systems as well. This extension module is designed to match the API of ncurses, an open-source curses library hosted on Linux and the BSD variants of Unix.
